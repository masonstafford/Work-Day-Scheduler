# Work-Day-Scheduler

 https://masonstafford.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

Project Description: A simple and easy to use day-planner that will let you add notes about what work related events are going on during hours 9am-5pm. Notes will be stored in local storage to make sure that they don’t disappear when the user refreshes the page. 

Tasks accomplished:
Make a good looking and easy to use web application.
Store the users input in local storage so when the user refreshes the page, data will still be visible on the site.
A working clock on the “header” portion of the site.
Dynamically updating text areas that change color based off of what hour it is, (dark blue = past, yellow = present, light green = future)
